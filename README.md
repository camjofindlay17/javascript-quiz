# JavaScript Quiz ReadMe

Created a JavaScript quiz i order to test an individual's knowledge of the subject. Individuals is asked to answer ten questions about the basic JavaScript syntax and a bit of historical knowledge surrounding it's creation. The user has 120 seconds to answer the questions.

If the user answers correctly, they are awarded with 10 points to their score. If the user answers incorrectly, they lose 10 seconds off of their time. The score and timer are available at the top of the quiz card as a way to keep track of score. The user is also prompted with the result of the previous question after they select thier anwswer and the next question, as it is a timed test and every second counts. 

At the end the user is prompted to put in their initials and they will be shown the Top Ten scores list.

Limitations: I was unable to figure out how to store the time variable to local storage after the quiz was complete. "Time Left" would have been a great added point variable to the final score, in order to create more variation with the scoring.
